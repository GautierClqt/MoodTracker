This repo will contain the 3rd project from OpenClassrooms Android developpment course.
It's called MoodTracker and the purpose of this application is to allow the user to register his mood on a daily basis and keep an history for 7 days.
User can also attach a comment when he registers his mood.
The application keeps one mood per day, user can change it multiple time during the day but only the one set at midnight will be record.
There's five mood to chose from: very bad mood, bad mood, normal mood, good mood and very good mood
Upon creation normal mood is the default mood; user can swipe up or down to a better or worse mood or leave it as it is.
A last feature, that need to be determined, will be added in a near future.
